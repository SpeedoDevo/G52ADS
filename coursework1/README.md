* Comments:
>- A5 There is some general form of inconsistency in the counting

>- B1 Graph is not as readable as it ought to be. E.g. remember to label the axes of a chart; otherwise the chart isnâ€™t useful for analysis. E.g. the legend is bad or uninformative.
>- C2 Failed to mention that the method p computes the log_2 or each number in the array
>- C8 No justifications, or some big gap in the logical argument.
>- C9 Missing big oh of best case, or big-omega of worst case
