# G52ADS coursework 3
* Grade: 85 / 100
* Comments:
>- A3 Insufficient testing description.
>- B1 No extra lines or upper/lower bounds were added on top of the raw data, that is, lack of ways to illustrate the scaling.
>- B2 Graph is not as readable as it ought to be. E.g. remember to label the axes of a chart; otherwise the chart isnâ€™t useful for analysis. E.g. the legend is bad or uninformative.
>- C1 No recognition/discussion of the main point which is that the tree will be shallower at larger d. A 4-ary tree will have about half the height, h, of a 2-ary tree, and since the upheap and downheap operate on paths between root and a leaves they will involve h nodes. Hence, a naive expectation might be for the 4-ary heap to be up to twice as fast.
>- C12 Lack of specific answers/justification, or incorrect answers.
